# A simple link sharing utility

Based on the [linkshare extension](https://github.com/glynnbird/linkshare), this small utility allows you to send links to another person with this extension installed. 

Taking advantage of the IndexDB local storage and synced with a CouchDB database in the cloud, links will show up in your friends extension whenever they next load the browser or a new tab. 

Right now it only works for Kev and I.
